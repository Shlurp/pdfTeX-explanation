\setsyntax{TeX}

This article assumes some preliminary knowledge of (plain-) \TeX, so I assume I don't need to introduce
\TeX{} to you.
pdf\TeX{} is a \TeX{} engine, which converts \TeX{} code to a PDF (historically, \TeX{} engines compiled to
DVI files).
In this part, we will discuss how to use pdf\TeX{} primitives to manipulate the underlying PDF with more
control than standard (Knuth-) \TeX{} primitives.

The main reference for this section is the pdf\TeX{} manual; consult it for information regarding primitives
not discussed here.
